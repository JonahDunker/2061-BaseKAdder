## Due: DoW MM/DD at 11:59 PM

- Create a program called `BaseKAdder.java`
- Prompt the user for an integer
  - This will be the base of the next two number
  - It can be any value greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20
- Prompt the user for two integers
  - These will be the numbers you need to add together
  - Print an error message if either number given is not a valid number for the given base and stop the program
- Print the sum of the two integers in the base that was given
